# TicketTracker
This is a program that will take into account the following nuances:
1. Tickets can be sold to both men and women.
2. You can sell to men from the age of 18
3. While women only from the age of 21.
4. At the same time, men over 65 are prohibited from attending the event
5. While there is no "maximum age" limit for women.

In this project:
1. I created this as 1 main function.
2. For convenience, I created basic types that will contain all the necessary information: age, gender, name, whether a person is of legal age, and so on.
3. Using if-else blocks, processed the data to understand whether it is possible to sell a ticket to a certain person.
4. Using the println() function, write the processing result to the terminal.
